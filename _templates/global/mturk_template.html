  <h3>Research Person Information: General Data Protection Regulation Notice</h3>

  <p>We would like to ask you if you want to participate in a research project. This document provides information about the project and what it means to participate.</p>

  <p><b>What kind of project do you want me to participate in?</b></p>

  <p>A social science experiment to study how the order and structure of informal communication affect social interactions</p>

  <p>The research principle for the project is Linköping University. The research principle means the organisation responsible for the study</p>

  <p><b>How does the study work?</b><p>

  <p>Participation is a two-hour online survey through the Amazon Mechanical Turk system. Each participant can participate only once</p>
  <p>The survey does not require participants to provide any personal information other than what is required to process their survey responses:

  <p><i>Amazon Mechanical Turk Worker ID and IP Address</i></p>

  <p><b>Possible consequences and risks of participating in the study</b></p>

  <p>No physical effects in the short or long term are likely to occur as a result of participation in this online survey. Only minor and short-term psychological discomfort is possible, but highly unlikely, through participation in the decision-making game and fixed parts of the opinion sharing in the survey.</p>

  <p><b>What happens to my information?</b></p>

  <p>The project will collect and record your choices and your responses to multiple choice questions.</p>

  <p>Linköping University collects information that you provide in your answers to the survey as well as information necessary to process the survey through Amazon Mechanical Turk.</p>

  <p>Your personal data will be processed only to verify unique participants in the experiment. The data will be retained until 31 March 2021, the end of the data collection phase of the experiment. They are then removed from Linköping University's systems and your answers will become completely anonymous. The data controller is Linköping University, 58183 Linköping, corporate registration number 202100-3096.</p>

  <p>Legal basis for data processing: Consent</p>

  <p>Your consent is valid until 31 March 2021.</p>

  <p>Your answers and results will be processed so that unauthorized persons cannot access them. Linköping University is responsible for your personal data. According to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, you have the right to access the data about you handled in the study free of charge and, if necessary, to have any errors corrected. You can also request that data about you are deleted and that the processing of your personal data be restricted. However, the right to erasure and restriction of the processing of personal data be restricted. However, the right to erasure and restriction of the processing of personal data does not apply when the data is necessary for the research in question. If you want to access the information, please contact Flora Samu (<a href="mailto: flora.samu@liu.se">flora.samu@liu.se</a>) or Karoly Takacs (<a href="mailto: karoly.takacs@liu.se">karoly.takacs@liu.se</a>). Data Protection Officers can be reached at <a href="mailto: dataskyddsombud@liu.se">dataskyddsombud@liu.se</a>. If you are dissatisfied with how your personal data is processed, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Swedish Data Protection Authority, which is the supervisory authority (from 1 January 2021, the Swedish Data Protection Authority is instead called the Swedish Data Protection Authority).</p>

  <p><b>How do I get information about the results of the study?</b></p>

  <p>If you have any questions, please contact: Matthew Maynard (<a href="mailto: matthew.maynard@liu.se">matthew.maynard@liu.se</a>) Liyu Pan (<a href="mailto: liyu.pan@liu.se">liyu.pan@liu.se</a>) Flora Samu (<a href="mailto: flora.samu@liu.se">flora.samu@liu.se</a>) or Karoly Takacs (<a href="mailto: karoly.takacs@liu.se">karoly.takacs@liu.se</a>)</p>

  <p><b>Compensation</b></p>

  <p>Each research participant will receive $15.00 for the completion of the online survey, as well as a variable amount up to $7.50 depending on their relative performance in the competitive parts of the experiment. Both payments will be paid through Amazon Mechanical Turk.</p>

  <p><b>Participation is voluntary</b></p>

  <p>Your participation is voluntary and you may choose to cancel participation at any time. If you choose not to participate or wish to cancel your participation, you do not need to state why, nor will affect your future care or treatment.
