            In the following task you are matched with participant one of the other participants
            who is the same as in the previous task. The amount you earn in this task will count 
            in your payment that you are going to receive at the end in cash.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10pt;">
            You have received <strong>20</strong> Monetary Units (MUs). 
            You can give some of it to this other participant  
            (please round up to one decimal, for instance 0.6). 
            The other participant has also received <strong>20</strong> MU and could also divide this amount 
            according to his/her will between him/her and you. 
        </P>
        <li>
            If your reward, which is the sum of what you keep and what you get from the other participant 
            is <strong>more</strong> than the reward of the other participant, 
            then you won and you will receive the amount that you KEPT yourself. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If your reward is <strong>lower</strong>, then you receive the amount that the other participant gave to you. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If the rewards are <strong>equal</strong>, we will make a lottery between these two options 
            in which there is 50% chance that you win and receive the money that you kept. 
        </li>

            Now please make a decision how much of your 20 Monetary Units (MUs) 
            would like to give to the other participant.</strog>
