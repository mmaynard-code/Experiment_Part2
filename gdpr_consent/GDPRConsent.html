            <h3>Research Person Information: General Data Protection Regulation Notice</h3>

<p>We would like to ask you if you want to participate in a research project. This document provides information about the project and what it means to participate.</p>

<p><b>What kind of project do you want me to participate in?</b></p>

<p>A social science experiment to study how the order and structure of informal communication affect social interactions</p>

<p>The research principle for the project is Linköping University. The research principle means the organisation responsible for the study</p>

<p><b>How does the study work?</b><p>

<p>Participation is a two-hour online survey through the Amazon Mechanical Turk system. Each participant can participate only once</p>
<p>The survey does not require participants to provide any personal information other than what is required to process their survey responses:

<p><i>Amazon Mechanical Turk Worker ID and IP Address</i></p>

<p><b>Possible consequences and risks of participating in the study</b></p>

<p>No physical effects in the short or long term are likely to occur as a result of participation in this online survey. Only minor and short-term psychological discomfort is possible, but highly unlikely, through participation in the decision-making game and fixed parts of the opinion sharing in the survey.</p>

<p><b>What happens to my information?</b></p>

<p>The project will collect and record your choices and your responses to multiple choice questions.</p>

<p>Linköping University collects information that you provide in your answers to the survey as well as information necessary to process the survey through Amazon Mechanical Turk.</p>

<p>Your personal data will be processed only to verify unique participants in the experiment. The data will be retained until 31 March 2021, the end of the data collection phase of the experiment.
